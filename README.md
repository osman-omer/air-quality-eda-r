# Exploratory Data Analysis – Airquality Dataset

## Description
This project is a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted as part of a **quiz and practice exercise**
from the **Johns Hopkins University – Data Science Specialization**.

The objective of this project is to practice core data analysis skills using R, including:
data inspection, data quality assessment, descriptive statistics, conditional subsetting,
and basic data visualization.

This project reflects my **current beginner level** in data analysis.

## Analysis Workflow
The analysis includes the following steps:
1. Initial data inspection (dimensions, structure, column names)
2. Data quality assessment (missing values)
3. Global descriptive statistics
4. Conditional subsetting and summary statistics
5. Time-specific analysis (May data)
6. Visualization of ozone distribution
